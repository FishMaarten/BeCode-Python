## Homebrew

On Mac, you need to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) which is a Package Manager.
It will be used as soon as we need to install some software.
To do so, open your Terminal and run:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

This will ask for your confirmation (hit `Enter`) and your laptop session password.

If you already have Homebrew, it will tell you so, that's fine, go on.

Then install some useful software:

```bash
brew update
```

If you get a `/usr/local must be writable` error, just run this:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local
brew update
```

Error message or not, proceed running the following in the terminal (you can copy / paste all the lines at once).

```bash
function install_or_upgrade { brew ls | grep $1 > /dev/null; if (($? == 0)); then brew upgrade $1; else brew install $1; fi }
install_or_upgrade "git"
install_or_upgrade "wget"
install_or_upgrade "imagemagick"
install_or_upgrade "jq"
install_or_upgrade "openssl"
```

## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your Terminal

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Be careful, at the end of this script, it will prompt for your laptop password again. You have to write it correctly (you will not see it when you type) and hit `Enter`. You should get something like:

```bash
         __                                     __
  ____  / /_     ____ ___  __  __   ____  _____/ /_
 / __ \/ __ \   / __ `__ \/ / / /  /_  / / ___/ __ \
/ /_/ / / / /  / / / / / / /_/ /    / /_(__  ) / / /
\____/_/ /_/  /_/ /_/ /_/\__, /    /___/____/_/ /_/
                        /____/                       ....is now installed!
```

Now quit the Terminal (`⌘` + `Q`), and restart it.

You should see something like this:

If not, **stop right away** and call a teacher.

On Mac, open `Terminal > Preferences` and set the "Pro" theme as default in `Profiles` (*`Réglages`* in French).

Quit and relaunch the Terminal. It should now have a nice black background, more easy on the eyes.

## Dotfiles (Standard configuration)

Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools. We'll start with a great default configuration provided by [Le Wagon](http://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles), stored on GitHub. As your configuration is personal, you need your own repository storing it, so you first need to fork it to your GitHub account.

:arrow_right: [Click here to **fork**](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles/fork) the `lewagon/dotfiles` repository to your account. Forking means that it will create a new repo in your GitHub account, identical to the original one. You'll have a new repository on your GitHub account, `your_github_username/dotfiles`. We need to fork because each of you will need to put specific information (e.g. your name) in those files.

Open your terminal. **Don't blindly copy paste this line**, replace `replace_this_with_your_github_username` with *your*
own github usernickname.

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=replace_this_with_your_github_username

# Example:
#   export GITHUB_USERNAME=ssaunier
```

Now copy/paste this very long line in your terminal. Do **not** change this one.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_ && git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
```

Run the `dotfiles` installer.

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
zsh install.sh
```

Then run the git installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles
zsh git_setup.sh
```

This will **prompt** you for your name (`Firstname Lastname`) and your email.

Be careful, you **need** to put the **same** email as the one you sign up with on GitHub.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.
