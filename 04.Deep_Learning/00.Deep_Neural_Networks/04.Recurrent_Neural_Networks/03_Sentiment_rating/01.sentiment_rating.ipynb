    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will going to see how to use the Keras library to build both a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that predict sentiment ratings for text sequences. Specifically, the models will predict the ratings associated with movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Networks for Language Data\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, neural networks encoded encode some input variables via a set of parameters (weights) that are optimized to predict some output variable. The simplest type of neural network is a feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) which operates on some feature representation of a linguistic input. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are an extension of this simple model that specifically model the sequential aspect of the input and thus are particularly useful for natural language processing tasks. The notebook demonstrates the code needed to assemble MLP and RNN models for an NLP task using the Keras library, as well as some data processing tools that facilitate building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand how to structure the input and output of the model, and know the fundamental concepts in machine learning, then a high-level understanding of how a neural network works is sufficient for using Keras. You'll see that most of the code here is actually just data manipulation, and I'll visualize each step in this process. The code used to assemble the models themselves is more minimal. It is of course useful to know these details, so you can theorize on the results and innovate the model to make it better. For a better understanding of neural networks and RNNs in particular, see the resources at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here a neural network will be used to encode the text of a movie review, and this representation will be used to predict the numerical rating assigned by the reviewer. The model shown here can be applied to any task where the goal is to predict a numerical score associated with a piece of text. Hopefully you can substitute your own datasets and/or modify the code to adapt it to other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a Python deep learning framework that lets you quickly put together neural network models with a minimal amount of code. It can be run on top of the mathematical optimization libraries [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) without you needing to know either of these underlying frameworks. It provides implementations of several of the layer architectures, objective functions, and optimization algorithms you need for building a machine learning model."

There are an equal number of positive and negative reviews. In the full dataset, the reviews are divided into train and test sets with 25,000 reviews each.

    "\n",
    "Before I show how to build an RNN for this task, I'll demonstrate an even simpler model, a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Unlike an RNN, an MLP model is not a sequence model - it represents data as a flat matrix of features rather than a time-ordered sequence of features. For language data, this generally means that the word order of a sequence will not be explicitly encoded into a model. The importance of word order varies for different NLP tasks; in some cases, order-sensitive approaches do not necessarily perform better.\n",

    "The simplest and most common representation of a text in NLP is as a bag-of-words vector. A bag-of-words vector encodes a sequence as an array with a dimension for each word in the lexicon. The value for each dimension is the number of times the word corresponding to that dimension appears in the text. Thus a dataset of text sequences is encoded as a matrix where each row represents a sequence and each column represents a word whose value is the frequency of that word in the sequence (it is also common to apply some weighting function to these values such as [tf-idf](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tf-idf-weighting-1.html), but here we'll just use counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the first dimension of the matrix has a count of 0 for all reviews, since there are no words represented by 0. This dimension is only relevant for the RNN model, where 0 will be used in a special way to indicate null words. This is explained fully below. For the MLP model, including this dimension won't make a difference because the model will learn to ignore it in making predictions."

    "\n",
    "To assemble the model, we'll use Keras' [Functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/), which is one of two ways to use Keras to assemble models (the alternative is the [Sequential API](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/), which is a bit simpler but has more constraints). A model consists of a series of layers. As shown in the code below, we initialize instances for each layer. Each layer can be called with another layer as input, e.g. Dense()(input_layer). A model instance is initialized with the Model() object, which defines the initial input and final output layers for that model. Before the model can be trained, the compile() function must be called with the loss function and optimization algorithm specified (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build an MLP with four layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Input**: The input layer takes in the matrix of sequence vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Dense (sigmoid activation)**: A hidden [layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense), which is what defines the model as a multilayer perceptron. This layer transforms the input matrix by applying a nonlinear transformation function (here, the sigmoid function). Intuitively, this layer can be thought of as computing a \"feature representation\" of the input words matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Dense (linear activation)**: An output layer that predicts the rating for the review based on its hidden representation given by the previous layer. This output is continuous (i.e. ranging from 1-10) rather than categorical, which means it has linear activation rather than nonlinear like the hidden layer (by default, activation='linear' for the Dense layer in Keras). The model gets feedback during training about what the actual ratings for the reviews should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"layer\" is just an abstraction, when really all these layers are just matrices. The \"weights\" that connect the layers are also matrices. The process of training a neural network is a series of matrix multiplications. The weight matrices are the values that are adjusted during training in order for the model to learn to predict ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Our function for creating the model takes two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_input_nodes**: In the case of reviews encoded as bag-of-words vectors, this is the number of unique words in the lexicon, plus one to account for the padding represented by 0 values (which are only relevant for the RNN model, but this dimension can be included here without any cost to the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_hidden_nodes**: the number of dimensions in the hidden layers. This can be freely chosen; here, it is set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the model is a single continuous value (the predicted rating), making this a regression rather than a classification model. There is only one dimension in the output layer, which contains the predicted rating. All neural networks learn by updating the parameters (weights) to optimize an objective (loss) function. For this model, the objective is to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings for the training reviews, thus bringing the predicted ratings closer to the real ratings. The details of this process are extensive; see the resources at the bottom of the notebook if you want a deeper understanding. One huge benefit of Keras is that it implements many of these details for you. Not only does it already have implementations of the types of layer architectures, it also has many of the [loss functions](https://keras.io/losses/) and [optimization methods](https://keras.io/optimizers/) you need for training various models. The specific loss function and optimization method you use is specified when compiling the model with the compile() function.\n",

    "### Exercise \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a ``create_mlp_model`` function. This finction will create an MLP model\n",

    "    2. **Dense (sigmoid activation)**: A hidden [layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense), which is what defines the model as a multilayer perceptron.\n",
    "    3. **Dense (linear activation)**: An output layer that predicts the rating for the review based on its hidden representation given by the previous layer.\n",

    "We can use the embeddings as an alternative to the simple bag-of-words input to the model, by averaging the embeddings for all words in the review across each corresponding dimension (you could also sum them). So instead of having an input matrix with a column for each word in the lexicon, each column represents a word embedding dimension. This is referred to as a continuous bag-of-words vector. The advantage of this representation over the standard bag-of-words representation is that it more explicitly represents the meaning of the words in the review. For example, two reviews may express similar content (and have similar ratings) but may vary in the exact words they use, so their continous bag-of-word vectors may be more similar than their standard bag-of-words vectors. The model may more readily observe that these reviews should receive similar ratings."

We need to put all the reviews in the training set into a single matrix, where each row is a review and each column is a word index in that sequence. This enables the model to process multiple sequences in parallel (batches) as opposed to one at a time. Using batches significantly speeds up training. However, each review has a different number of words, so we create a padded matrix equal to the length on the longest review in the training set. For all reviews with fewer words, we prepend the row with zeros representing an empty word position. This is why the number 0 was not assigned as a word index in the lexicon.

The difference here is that rather than plugging in embeddings from a pretrained model as before, the word embeddings will be learned inside the model itself. Thus, the input to the model will be the word indices rather than their embeddings, and the embedding values will change as the model is trained. The mask_zero=True parameter in this layer indicates that values of 0 in the matrix (the padding) will be ignored by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. GRU**: A [recurrent (GRU) hidden layer](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/), the central component of the model. As it observes each word in the review, it integrates the word embedding representation with what it's observed so far to compute a representation (hidden state) of the review at that timepoint. There are a few architectures for this layer - I use the GRU variation, Keras also provides LSTM or just the simple vanilla recurrent layer (see the materials at the bottom for an explanation of the difference). This layer outputs the last hidden state of the sequence (i.e. the hidden representation of the review after its last word is observed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Dense**: An output [layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense) that predicts the rating for the review based on its GRU representation given by the previous layer. This is the same output layer used in the MLP, so it has one dimension that contains a continuous value (the rating).\n",

For ratings prediction, this output is ordinal, but it could also be categorical with a few simple changes to the output layer of the model. My other notebooks in this repository for language modeling/generation and part-of-speech tagging demonstrate this type of prediction with categorical variables. They also show how to build an RNN in Keras when the output is a sequence of labels, rather than a single value as shown here."
