    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful and easy-to-use Python libraries for developing and evaluating deep learning models is Keras; It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow. The advantage of this is mainly that you can get started with neural networks in an easy and fun way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is an API designed for human beings, not machines, it follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going deeper into Keras and how you can use it to get started with deep learning in Python, you should probably know a thing or two about neural networks. As you briefly read in the previous section, neural networks found their inspiration and biology, where the term “neural network” can also be used for neurons. The human brain is then an example of such a neural network, which is composed of a number of neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, as you all know, the brain is capable of performing quite complex computations, and this is where the inspiration for Artificial Neural Networks comes from. The network a whole is a powerful modeling tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perceptrons\n",
    "The most simple neural network is the “perceptron”, which, in its simplest form, consists of a single neuron. Much like biological neurons, which have dendrites and axons, the single artificial neuron is a simple tree structure which has input nodes and a single output node, which is connected to each input node. Here’s a visual comparison of the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/perceptron.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the picture, there are six components to artificial neurons. From left to right, these are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Input nodes. As it so happens, each input node is associated with a numerical value, which can be any real number. Remember that real numbers make up the full spectrum of numbers: they can be positive or negative, whole or decimal numbers.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Connections. Similarly, each connection that departs from the input node has a weight associated with it, and this can also be any real number.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Next, all the values of the input nodes and weights of the connections are brought together: they are used as inputs for a weighted sum: y=f(∑Di=1wi∗xi), or, stated differently, y=f(w1∗x1+w2∗x2+...wD∗xD).\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. This result will be the input for a transfer or activation function. In the simplest but trivial case, this transfer function would be an identity function, f(x)=x or y=x. In this case, x is the weighted sum of the input nodes and the connections. However, just like a biological neuron only fires when a certain threshold is exceeded, the artificial neuron will also only fire when the sum of the inputs exceeds a threshold, let’s say for example 0. This is something that you can’t find back in an identity function! The most intuitive way that one can think of is by devising a system like the following:\n",
    "       f(x)=0 if x<0\n",
    "    f(x)=0.5 if x=0\n",
    "    f(x)=1 if x>0\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. Of course, you can already imagine that the output is not going to be a smooth line: it will be a discontinuous function. Because this can cause problems in the mathematical processing, a continuous variant, the sigmoid function, is often used. An example of a sigmoid function that you might already know is the logistic function. Using this function results in a much smoother result!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. As a result, you have the output node, which is associated with the function (such as the sigmoid function) of the weighted sum of the input nodes. Note that the sigmoid function is a mathematical function that results in an “S” shaped curve; You’ll read more about this later.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 7. Lastly, the perceptron may be an additional parameter, called a bias, which you can consider as the weight associated with an additional input node that is permanently set to 1. The bias value is critical because it allows you to shift the activation function to the left or right, which can make a determine the success of your learning.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the logical consequence of this model is that perceptrons only work with numerical data. This implies that you should convert any nominal data into a numerical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know that perceptrons work with thresholds, the step to using them for classification purposes isn’t that far off: the perceptron can agree that any output above a certain threshold indicates that an instance belongs to one class, while an output below the threshold might result in the input being a member of the other class. The straight line where the output equals the threshold is then the boundary between the two classes.\n"

    "### Multi-Layer Perceptrons\n",
    "Networks of perceptrons are multi-layer perceptrons, and this is what this tutorial will implement in Python with the help of Keras! Multi-layer perceptrons are also known as “feed-forward neural networks”. As you sort of guessed by now, these are more complex networks than the perceptron, as they consist of multiple neurons that are organized in layers. The number of layers is usually limited to two or three, but theoretically, there is no limit!\n",
    "\n",
    "The layers act very much like the biological neurons that you have read about above: the outputs of one layer serve as the inputs for the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the layers, you can distinguish an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Multi-layer perceptrons are often fully connected. This means that there’s a connection from each perceptron in a specific layer to each perceptron in the next layer. Even though the connectedness is no requirement, this is typically the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the perceptron could only represent linear separations between classes, the multi-layer perceptron overcomes that limitation and can also represent more complex decision boundaries."

    "#### Understanding The Data\n",
    "However, before you start loading in the data, it might be a good idea to check how much you really know about wine (in relation to the dataset, of course). Most of you will know that there are, in general, two very popular types of wine: red and white.\n",
    "\n",
    "(I’m sure that there are many others, but for simplicity and because of my limited knowledge of wines, I’ll keep it at this. I’m sorry if I’m disappointing the true connoisseurs among you :)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this is already one thing, but if you want to analyze this data, you will need to know just a little bit more.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check out the data description folder to see which variables have been included. This is usually the first step to understanding your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of two datasets that are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. As stated in the description, you’ll only find physicochemical and sensory variables included in this data set. The data description file lists the 12 variables that are included in the data, but for those who, like me, aren’t really chemistry experts either, here’s a short description of each variable:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Fixed acidity: acids are major wine properties and contribute greatly to the wine’s taste. Usually, the total acidity is divided into two groups: the volatile acids and the nonvolatile or fixed acids. Among the fixed acids that you can find in wines are the following: tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic. This variable is expressed in g(tartaricacid)/dm3 in the data sets.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Volatile acidity: the volatile acidity is basically the process of wine turning into vinegar. In the U.S, the legal limits of Volatile Acidity are 1.2 g/L for red table wine and 1.1 g/L for white table wine. In these data sets, the volatile acidity is expressed in g(aceticacid)/dm3.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Citric acid is one of the fixed acids that you’ll find in wines. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the two data sets.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Residual sugar typically refers to the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, or is stopped. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the red and white data.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Chlorides can be a significant contributor to saltiness in wine. Here, you’ll see that it’s expressed in g(sodiumchloride)/dm3.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Free sulfur dioxide: the part of the sulfur dioxide that is added to a wine and that is lost into it is said to be bound, while the active part is said to be free. The winemaker will always try to get the highest proportion of free sulfur to bind. This variable is expressed in mg/dm3 in the data.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Total sulfur dioxide is the sum of the bound and the free sulfur dioxide (SO2). Here, it’s expressed in mg/dm3. There are legal limits for sulfur levels in wines: in the EU, red wines can only have 160mg/L, while white and rose wines can have about 210mg/L. Sweet wines are allowed to have 400mg/L. For the US, the legal limits are set at 350mg/L, and for Australia, this is 250mg/L.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Density is generally used as a measure of the conversion of sugar to alcohol. Here, it’s expressed in g/cm3.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - pH or the potential of hydrogen is a numeric scale to specify the acidity or basicity the wine. As you might know, solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. With a pH of 7, pure water is neutral. Most wines have a pH between 2.9 and 3.9 and are therefore acidic.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Sulfates are to wine as gluten is to food. You might already know sulfites from the headaches that they can cause. They are a regular part of the winemaking around the world and are considered necessary. In this case, they are expressed in g(potassiumsulphate)/dm3.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Alcohol: wine is an alcoholic beverage, and as you know, the percentage of alcohol can vary from wine to wine. It shouldn’t be surprised that this variable is included in the data sets, where it’s expressed in % vol.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Quality: wine experts graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). The eventual number is the median of at least three evaluations made by those same wine experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This all, of course, is some very basic information that you might need to know to get started. If you’re a true wine connoisseur, you probably know all of this and more!\n",

That means that you’re looking to build a fairly simple stack of fully-connected layers to solve this problem. As for the activation function that you will use, it’s best to use one of the most common ones here for the purpose of getting familiar with Keras and neural networks, which is the relu activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how do you start building your multi-layer perceptron? A quick way to get started is to use the Keras Sequential model: it’s a linear stack of layers. You can easily create the model by passing a list of layer instances to the constructor, which you set up by running model = Sequential().\n",

When you’re making your model, it’s therefore important to take into account that your first layer needs to make the input shape clear. The model needs to know what input shape to expect and that’s why you’ll always find the input_shape, input_dim, input_length, or batch_size arguments in the documentation of the layers and in practical examples of those layers.\n",

    "In the first layer, the activation argument takes the value relu. Next, you also see that the input_shape has been defined. This is the input of the operation that you have just seen: the model takes as input arrays of shape (12,), or (*, 12). Lastly, you see that the first layer has 12 as a first value for the units argument of Dense(), which is the dimensionality of the output space and which are actually 12 hidden units. This means that the model will output arrays of shape (*, 12): this is is the dimensionality of the output space. Don’t worry if you don’t get this entirely just now, you’ll read more about it later on!\n",
    "\n",
    "The units actually represents the kernel of the above formula or the weights matrix, composed of all weights given to all input nodes, created by the layer. Note that you don’t include any bias in the example below, as you haven’t included the use_bias argument and set it to TRUE, which is also a possibility.\n",

The choice for a loss function depends on the task that you have at hand: for example, for a regression problem, you’ll usually use the Mean Squared Error (MSE). As you see in this example, you used [binary_crossentropy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/binary_crossentropy) for the binary classification problem of determining whether a wine is red or white.
