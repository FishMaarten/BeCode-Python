    "## Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "In layman's terms, a tensor is a way of representing the data in deep learning. A tensor can be a 1-dimensional, a 2-dimensional, a 3-dimensional array, etc. You can think of a tensor as a multidimensional array. In machine learning and deep learning, you have datasets that are high dimensional, in which each dimension represents a different feature of that dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example of a dog versus cat classification problem, where the dataset you're working with has multiple varieties of both cats and dogs images. Now, in order to correctly classify a dog or a cat when given an image, the network has to learn discriminative features like color, face structure, ears, eyes, the shape of the tail, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    " - In the conv2d() function, you pass 4 arguments: input x, weights W, bias b, and strides. This last argument is by default set to 1, but you can always play with it to see how the network performs. The first and last stride must always be 1 because the first is for the image-number, and the last is for the input-channel (since the image is a gray-scale image which has only one channel). After applying the convolution, you will add bias and apply an activation function called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - The max-pooling function is simple: it has the input x and a kernel size k, which is set to be 2. This means that the max-pooling filter will be a square matrix with dimensions 2 x 2, and the stride by which the filter will move in is also 2.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "You will be padding equal to the same which ensures that while performing the convolution operations, the boundary pixels of the image are not left out, so padding equal to same will basically add zeros at the boundaries of the input and allow the convolution filter to access the boundary pixels as well.\n",

    "Similarly, max-pooling operation padding equal to the same will add zeros. Later, when you define the weights and the biases, you will notice that input of size 28 x 28 is downsampled to 4 x 4 after applying three max-pooling layers."

The first key in the biases dictionary, bc1, will have 32 bias parameters.\n",

That's why you do the multiplication operation 44128, which is the output of the previous layer or number of channels that are outputted by the convolution layer 3. The second element of the tuple that you pass to shape has number of neurons that you want in the fully connected layer. Similarly, in the biases dictionary, the fourth key bd1 has 128 parameters.\n",

Since this is a multi-class classification problem, you will use softmax activation on the output layer. This will give you probabilities for each class label. The loss function you use is cross-entropy.\n",

These are both properties you would intuitively expect for a cost function. It avoids the problem of learning to slow down, which means that if the weights and biases are initialized in a wrong fashion, it helps in recovering faster and does not hamper much of the training phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, you define both the activation and the cross-entropy loss functions in one line. You pass two parameters, which are the predicted output and the ground truth label y. You will then take the mean (reduce_mean), which will compute the mean loss over all instances in a single batch and not the average over all the batches since you will be training your model in a mini-batch fashion.\n",
